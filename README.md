Important: http request is not working: 

Message error:
https://dev.myjobglasses.com/professionals?page=1&format=json Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://dev.myjobglasses.com/professionals?page=1&format=json.
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 404.
